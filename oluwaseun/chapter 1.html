<p>It was a sad friday morning in Mr Adeyemi compound,where a loud wailing took place because the important treasure which is Mrs Adeyemi had just died.A woman of 42 years of age who gave birth 3 children a boy and two girls namely Toyin,Dayo and Ola.The death of their mother is a very great loss to their family.Mr Adeyemi is a great bussiness man who love his family very well.The burial took place the second day which was on saturday.Tears was dripping out of the peoples eyes like rain from the atmosphere.</p>
One month later the three children resume school.Toyin as the first child is in ss2,Dayo is in jss3,while Ola is in Primary5.Their mother's friend whose name was Adeola,but usually called Anty Adeola because she is out of wedlock, by Toyin and her siblings,but people called her mama Mariam,usually come to their house to sometimes help them take care of their house when the children laeave for school.This continued for a long period of time and she made the children love her.One day Toyin caled her father and she told him to marry Adeola.After a lot of pressure he later accept to marry her.</p>
After three months of their wedding,Adeola change her behaviour towards the children and she brought Mariam whom she gave birth to out of wedlock to start living with them.She change Toyin and her siblings square  meal to one each day.She made them do all the house chores with her child doing nothing.Her child enjoyed as if she is the biological child of Mr Adeyemi.Adeola made Toyin to hawk during weekends cause their father is not always around.He can travel for 2 months.Whenever their father called she would threaten them to talk to their father  very well.She made to wear rags and torn clothes and she spents all the money the man send for all the children on her own child only for buying irrelevant things.She allow Toyin to miss class for a week,the principal was forced to call Mr Adeyemi but the call was disconnecting</p
>One day toyin saw a form in her school about who want to write waec but since she is still in ss2 it would not be useful for her so she ignored it.toyin regretted her actions of telling her father to marry Adeola.Ola felt sick due to malnutrition but instead of his stepmum taking him to the hospital,she only cooked herbs for him but Ola as a strong boy quiickly recovered.The children were not allowed to go out except Mariam.Mariam is a very spoilt child that everybody in her school disliked her.She is always making noise in the class,not submitting assignments and always failing woefully during test and examination,But her mother never scold her for that.Toyin was in ss3 and she wanted to do an examination.She told her stepmother but that only worsened the case as she was told to cancel the examination,but she never do that instead she worked for the money for the money wrote the exam without her mother awareness.At the end she came out in flying colours.One day Adeola went out for a party not knowing that Mr Adeyemi would be coming back home from his journey gave Toyin and her siblings alone at home with a lot of work to do and rags on their body and going out with only Mariam.Mr Adeyemi was shocked to see his lovely children in that manner and guess what he treated Adeola fucked up.</p>
